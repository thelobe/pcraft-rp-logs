20:26 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
20:26 - Filly Celestia is sleeping... in her bed.. alone...
20:26 - Doctor Whoof is attempting not to crash the TARDIE through stained glass windows
20:26 - Nurse Sexyheart trots around the infirmary, which is eerily quiet due to the lack of patients
20:26 - Filly Celestia: (:/ whoof NOT crashing.. LOLOLOL)
20:27 - Doctor Whoof: (lol)
20:27 - Doctor Whoof is not doing to well on that not setting the TARDIE on fire thing
20:27 - Filly Celestia: (FAGGOTS.. DO SOMETHING)
20:28 - Sugarberry is somewhere doing something
20:28 - Sugarberry: (Happy?)
20:28 - Doctor Whoof crashes through a window into a room
20:28 - Nurse Sexyheart: Hm... nobody here... maybe time for some fun~
20:28 - Filly Celestia: (... you whore)
20:28 - Doctor Whoof pops his head out
20:28 - Doctor Whoof: Sorry
20:28 - The Lobe: My window!
20:28 - The Lobe: Wait...
20:28 - Doctor Whoof: So sorry
20:28 - The Lobe: it's _you_...
20:29 - The Lobe glares at Whoof
20:29 - Doctor Whoof: I was dealing with the daleks...
20:29 - Doctor Whoof: and there was space plague
20:29 - Doctor Whoof: ...
20:29 - Doctor Whoof: sorry
20:29 - The Lobe: Why, out of all windows you could crash through, did you have to crash through mine?
20:30 - Doctor Whoof: So, anything catostrophic about to happen?
20:30 - Nurse Sexyheart trots to her private lounge and shuts the door, locking it despite the whole building being empty
20:30 - Doctor Whoof: I'm not sure why
20:30 - Doctor Whoof: Maybe It brought me here for a reason
20:30 - Filly Celestia is still sleeping XD
20:30 - The Lobe: Well, nothing catastrophic was about to happen before you crashed in here
20:30 - Doctor Whoof: Oh, sorry
20:31 - The Lobe: But catastrophes tend to follow you wherever you go, so...
20:31 - Doctor Whoof: So, need anything investigated?
20:31 - Doctor Whoof: Any weird noises?
20:31 - Doctor Whoof: something strange?
20:31 - Doctor Whoof: an invisible man sleeping in your bed?
20:31 - The Lobe: No, and I know who I'd call if that was the case.
20:32 - Doctor Whoof: Fair point
20:32 - Doctor Whoof: So...
20:32 - Doctor Whoof: uh...
20:32 - Doctor Whoof: Nice seeing you again
20:32 - The Lobe: Meh... now I need to get that window replaced
20:32 - Doctor Whoof: Right
20:32 - Doctor Whoof: uhh
20:32 - Doctor Whoof runsinto the TARDIE
20:32 - Doctor Whoof: One moment!@
20:33 - The Lobe follows him carefully
20:33 - Nurse Sexyheart trots over to a locked cabinet in her lounge, pulling a key from the lining of her hat
20:33 - The Lobe: I mean, gee, it sure is boring around here, but that was kinda unnecessary.
20:33 - Doctor Whoof comes back with a bag marked "1000 bits"
20:34 - Doctor Whoof: Is this enough for a new window?
20:34 - Doctor Whoof: I can never tell
20:34 - Doctor Whoof: currency, it's so confusing
20:34 - The Lobe: Where did you get that?
20:34 - Sugarberry steps out into the street from the now quiet house, a black sack saddled her back, hooves still slightly bloodied after a hurried attempt to clean them
20:35 - Doctor Whoof: I'm a time traveler, I know exactly where to sell my stockas
20:35 - The Lobe: Yeah, right.
20:35 - Doctor Whoof: So, is that enough?
20:35 - The Lobe: Forgot about that... yes, that would be enough I guess...
20:36 - The Lobe: so anyway... where are you headed?
20:36 - Doctor Whoof hoofs over the moneysack
20:36 - Doctor Whoof: I'm not sure, the TARDIE is acting like it's sick
20:37 - Doctor Whoof: I can't get her to time travel very well anyway
20:37 - Filly Celestia wakes up to her alarm clock..
20:37 - Doctor Whoof: So flying isn mildly safer
20:37 - Doctor Whoof: So, do you want to come with me on an adventure?
20:37 - The Lobe: I guess...
20:37 - Doctor Whoof: or do you want to stay home and repair your window?
20:37 - The Lobe le shrug
20:38 - Doctor Whoof: Okay
20:38 - Filly Celestia yawns and walks out onto her balcony
20:38 - Doctor Whoof goes over to the controls
20:38 - Doctor Whoof: TIME FOR ADVENTURE
20:38 - The Lobe: I'm not good at repairing things, somepony else is gonna have to do that for me
20:38 - Filly Celestia: (ADVENTURE TIME)
20:38 - The Lobe steps inside the TARDIE
20:38 - Doctor Whoof starts flying the TARDIE, crashing into several things in the living room
20:38 - Doctor Whoof flys out
20:39 - The Lobe: D:
20:39 - Doctor Whoof: I'll replace those
20:39 - Sugarberry heads towards her home shifting the sack occasionally. "The sun will be rising soon" she thought to herself and quickened her pace
20:39 - Doctor Whoof sets a course for canterlot
20:39 - The Lobe: Where are we going?
20:39 - Nurse Sexyheart grabs a book from the cabinet, quickly shutting and locking it
20:39 - Doctor Whoof: You know I need to give the queen a visit
20:40 - Sugarberry: (Queen?)
20:40 - Nurse Sexyheart glances around quickly, making sure nopony is there
20:40 - Filly Celestia: (shush)
20:40 - Doctor Whoof: (that's the point)
20:40 - Nurse Sexyheart: (MORRI IS A QUEEEEEEEEEEEN
20:40 - Nurse Sexyheart: *)
20:40 - Filly Celestia: (shh)

20:40 - Sugarberry: (wat)
20:40 - The Lobe: What queen?
20:40 - Doctor Whoof: Oh, right this is early history
20:40 - Nurse Sexyheart: (he's both)
20:40 - Doctor Whoof: still a princess I suppose
20:41 - Doctor Whoof: Well, I'm sure I'tll be no problem
20:41 - The Lobe: Uh.... oh... time-traveller. Right.
20:41 - Doctor Whoof starts looking paniced as sparks start flying from the controls
20:41 - The Lobe: Umm... is it supposed to do that?
20:42 - Doctor Whoof: Possibly
20:42 - Doctor Whoof: I never really read the manual
20:42 - The Lobe doesn't look surprised
20:42 - The Lobe: of course not...
20:42 - Doctor Whoof is starting to loose altitude
20:42 - Doctor Whoof: Okay at this rate...
20:42 - Doctor Whoof: We'll land...
20:43 - Doctor Whoof: On the princesses balcony
20:43 - Doctor Whoof: I'm sure it'll be fine
20:43 - Nurse Sexyheart lounges on a bed, opening the book and gazing over its pages
20:43 - Doctor Whoof: That or we rush someone to death...
20:44 - The Lobe is cowering in a corner, hooves over his head
20:44 - The Lobe: Just don't kill us...
20:44 - Doctor Whoof starts flying through the air, visible to celestia because of the fire
20:44 - Doctor Whoof: Oh, you know me better than that
20:44 - Filly Celestia notices the flaming object hurduling toward her..
20:44 - Filly Celestia: What is that?
20:44 - Filly Celestia: .... and why is it headed right for me?
20:45 - Doctor Whoof attempts to slow down the TARDIE to a non-lethal speed
20:45 - Filly Celestia: .... what.. ... is .....
20:45 - Filly Celestia runs back into her room and hides under the bed.
20:45 - Doctor Whoof embeds the TARDIE into the thick stone walls of the palace
20:45 - Doctor Whoof: Well, that went worse then expected
20:46 - Sugarberry gets to her home, slipping the sack from her back and putting it in the corner of the main room before heading to the kitchen to make some coffee
20:46 - The Lobe is thrown into a wall
20:46 - Doctor Whoof opens the door of the now sid-ways TARDIE
20:46 - The Lobe falls of the wall, leaving a pegasus-shaped dent
20:46 - Doctor Whoof: Wow, I landed her eon her side
20:46 - The Lobe: off*
20:46 - Filly Celestia feels the crash and wonders what is going on, but is too frightened to come out
20:47 - Doctor Whoof: Hello?
20:47 - Doctor Whoof: Princess?
20:47 - Doctor Whoof: Are you there?
20:47 - Filly Celestia wimpers
20:48 - Doctor Whoof: Oooohh...

20:49 - Doctor Whoof: (eeyup)
20:49 - Doctor Whoof: I didn't mean to frighten you...
20:49 - Doctor Whoof: You see, my time machine crahed
20:50 - Doctor Whoof: *crashed
20:50 - Doctor Whoof jumps out of the TARDIE
20:50 - The Lobe gets back on his hooves, and slowly walks towards the exit
20:50 - Doctor Whoof: Okay, well I'm not going to attempt to step into your room
20:50 - Doctor Whoof: Because there are alarms
20:51 - Doctor Whoof: And I like NOT being in jail
20:51 - Filly Celestia yells from under the bed, "WHY ARE YOU IN MY CASTLE?!"
20:51 - Filly Celestia yells, "GO AWAY!!!"
20:51 - Doctor Whoof: I came for a visit, but I didn't realize that you're so young this time around
20:52 - Doctor Whoof: Sorry,
20:52 - Filly Celestia yells, "RAPIST!!! HE'S GONNA RAPE ME!! GUARDS!!! "
20:52 - Doctor Whoof: I haven't heard that one in a long time
20:53 - Doctor Whoof: No, to pilot the TARDIE out before I'm in the royal jail for  thousand  yoears
20:53 - Doctor Whoof: *now

20:53 - Filly Celestia: (LMAO.. you can't spell)
20:53 - Doctor Whoof goes to the gravitationally challenged TARDIE
20:54 - Doctor Whoof: I hate when I land on it on her side
20:54 - Filly Celestia: ( hoof today http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/164.jpg )
20:54 - Doctor Whoof: (pretty mucch)
20:54 - Nurse Sexyheart: (me every day)
20:54 - Sugarberry returns with her coffee and notices the content of the sack is making efforts to escape
20:54 - Doctor Whoof: So, uh

20:55 - Doctor Whoof: sorry about that princess, I'll just leave noiw
20:55 - Doctor Whoof leaves a note on the ground
20:55 - Filly Celestia wonders where the guards are

20:55 - Doctor Whoof locks the doors
20:55 - Doctor Whoof: Okay then lobe

20:56 - The Lobe is not impressed
20:57 - Doctor Whoof: What?
20:57 - Doctor Whoof: I've done worse than this
20:57 - The Lobe notices that he's been standing on a button all the time
20:57 - Doctor Whoof looks at the button
20:57 - Doctor Whoof: Oh my...
20:57 - Sugarberry trots over and opens up the sack revealing a small pegasus foal, bound and gagged staring wide eyed in fear up at her
20:57 - The Lobe: Oh my?
20:57 - Doctor Whoof: So uh

20:58 - Filly Celestia starts to crawl out from under her bed
20:58 - The Lobe: (Sugar, all my clop)
20:58 - Filly Celestia: (^)
20:58 - Doctor Whoof makes the TARDIE de-matirialize
20:58 - The Lobe steps back on the button
20:58 - Doctor Whoof: FInally, that's working again
20:59 - Doctor Whoof: Well, she'll remember that sound the rest of her life
20:59 - Doctor Whoof: So, I have all of time and space
20:59 - Doctor Whoof: where do you want to go?
20:59 - The Lobe: uhhh.... didn't you want to visit her at a later time?
21:00 - Doctor Whoof: yes I probably should
21:00 - Doctor Whoof: I hope I didn't screw up the timeline to much
21:00 - The Lobe: *mumbles* wouldn't be the first time...
21:01 - Doctor Whoof: otherwise, I've made a very powerful enemy
21:02 - The Lobe: Let's hope you haven't.
21:02 - Doctor Whoof: Lets.
21:02 - Filly Celestia climbs out from under her bed... and heads out the door
21:02 - Doctor Whoof: So
21:02 - Filly Celestia: Where are those guards
21:04 - Filly Celestia: (quick question... who is nyx?)
21:04 - The Lobe: (some oc that got way too much attention)
21:04 - Doctor Whoof: (Nyx is from a very nice Fan fic)
21:04 - The Lobe: (but the fic is nice, yes)
21:04 - Filly Celestia: (ic ic )
21:05 - Nurse Sexyheart: (Nyx should burn)
21:05 - Sugarberry levitates the pegasus, carries it down to her cellar and places it down into one of several cages lining a wall, "If you behave I'll come and untie you later.."
21:06 - Doctor Whoof: So, lets go to "modern" equestria to see adult Celestia
21:06 - The Lobe: Can I step off the button now?
21:07 - Doctor Whoof: Yes, I think it won't cause the sun to explode now
21:07 - The Lobe: It--- okaaay...
21:07 - The Lobe carefully steps off the button, watching out for exploding suns
21:08 - Doctor Whoof: Yes, I think we're fine
21:08 - Doctor Whoof starts hitting buttons and flipping levers
21:08 - Doctor Whoof: BACK, TO THE FUTURE
21:08 - The Lobe: Gah! Stop shouting! I always expect something bad to happen if you shout.
21:09 - Doctor Whoof pulls out a rubber hicken
21:09 - Doctor Whoof: *chicken
21:09 - Doctor Whoof starts beating the controls
21:09 - Filly Celestia has been searching the entire castle but can't find any guards
21:09 - Filly Celestia can't find anyone at all
21:10 - Doctor Whoof: I just hope she'll trust that note I left on the balcony
21:10 - The Lobe watches, awestruck by the virtousity and precision the Doctor is controlling the TARDIE with
21:11 - Doctor Whoof: (lol)
21:11 - Nurse Sexyheart is jolted out of her relaxation as she hears a strange noise from somewhere in the infirmary
21:11 - Nurse Sexyheart: Was that...?  A TARDIE?
21:11 - Doctor Whoof lands the TARDIE
21:12 - Doctor Whoof: I love that landing noise

21:12 - Filly Celestia notices the note on the balcony
21:13 - Filly Celestia picks it up
21:13 - Filly Celestia: (wats it say faggot)
21:13 - Nurse Sexyheart quicky puts away her book in the cabinet and steps out of the room
21:14 - Doctor Whoof: (Basically, that I'm the doctor the time machine I use is sick, and that something bad might happen and he came to check on you)
21:14 - Filly Celestia: (oki)
21:14 - Doctor Whoof: (not that you'de have to trust it)
21:14 - Nurse Sexyheart calls into the empty halls "Doctor, are you here?"
21:15 - Doctor Whoof 's ears perk up
21:15 - Doctor Whoof: red heart!
21:15 - Doctor Whoof bursts throught the TARDIE doors
21:15 - Sugarberry scribbles some notes into a ledger before heading back upstairs sipping her coffee
21:15 - The Lobe follows the Doctor
21:15 - Nurse Sexyheart: This had better be important Doctor, I was, uh, busy.
21:15 - Doctor Whoof: Lobe, I assume you know red
21:16 - Doctor Whoof: Sorry, I think I screwed up the timeline
21:16 - The Lobe: Yes... I think we've met before
21:16 - Nurse Sexyheart: We've met.
21:16 - Doctor Whoof: So, I decided to go into the future, I didn't mean to land here though
21:16 - Doctor Whoof: The TARDIE is sick
21:17 - Nurse Sexyheart: Oh, so nothing new then.
21:17 - Filly Celestia runs down and out of the castle
21:17 - Doctor Whoof: Nope
21:17 - Doctor Whoof: Exept the Filly Celestia thinks I'm a Rapist
21:17 - Nurse Sexyheart: Hm.
21:17 - Nurse Sexyheart: That could be a problem.
21:18 - Doctor Whoof: Ya...
21:18 - Doctor Whoof: So, Did I hit the right timeline?
21:18 - Doctor Whoof: Is the princess an adult?
21:18 - Nurse Sexyheart: Well...

21:18 - Filly Celestia searches around town... calling out to anypony that can hear her
21:19 - Nurse Sexyheart: The other one... went missing years ago.
Oceanity left chat.
21:19 - Nurse Sexyheart: Luna runs Equestria now.
21:19 - Doctor Whoof: You mean luna?
21:20 - Sugarberry goes to her bathroom and scrubs the remaining dried blood from her hooves, checking herself in the mirror she notices a small wound on her forehead "Guess I should go see the nurse.."
21:20 - Nurse Sexyheart: Yes, the damn ty-
21:20 - Doctor Whoof: Hm?
21:20 - Nurse Sexyheart cuts herself short and glances around.
21:20 - Nurse Sexyheart: The walls have ears.
21:21 - Doctor Whoof: Not the TARDIE
21:21 - Nurse Sexyheart: Doctor.
21:21 - Nurse Sexyheart: Your TARDIE is sick.
21:21 - Nurse Sexyheart: It can't be trusted.
21:22 - Doctor Whoof: Wha?

21:23 - Nurse Sexyheart: I suppose that could work.
21:23 - Filly Celestia calls out to anypony
21:23 - Filly Celestia: There has to be someone... right?
21:23 - Filly Celestia starts getting scared
21:23 - Doctor Whoof: Okay
21:23 - Nurse Sexyheart: But with Celestia missing, Luna's power has spiraled out of control.
21:23 - Doctor Whoof: Step in the TARDIE
21:23 - Doctor Whoof: Wow
21:23 - Nurse Sexyheart sighs "I just wanted a night off..."
21:24 - Nurse Sexyheart steps into the TARDIE

23:55 - Nurse Sexyheart: Ah, right.
23:58 - Doctor Whoof wonders the darkened hallways, alone
23:58 - Nurse Sexyheart: Well I guess I can tell you Sugar.
23:59 - Sugarberry: Hmm..? Tell me what now?
23:59 - Nurse Sexyheart: We're here to find Celestia.
23:59 - Nurse Sexyheart: A lost memory of her.
23:59 - Sugarberry: Celestia..?

00:47 - The Doctor's Son: Has anyone seen my TARDIS?
00:47 - Nurse Sexyheart: I see
00:47 - The Doctor's Son: I crashed somewhere. . .
00:47 - Nurse Sexyheart: wait

00:48 - The Doctor's Son: Yes.
00:48 - Doctor Whoof: Just like i'm a timepony
00:48 - Nurse Sexyheart: biped
00:48 - The Doctor's Son: Yes.
00:48 - Doctor Whoof: She didn't beleive me
00:48 - Nurse Sexyheart: Does not compute.
00:48 - The Doctor's Son: You have a firm grasp of what Humanoid means.
00:48 - The Doctor's Son: It's quite simple.
00:48 - Nurse Sexyheart: Doc has told me.
00:48 - The Doctor's Son: Seeing as how you're paused, I'll give you the story.
00:49 - Nurse Sexyheart: So I know the terms.
00:49 - Nurse Sexyheart: But I didn't believe him.
00:49 - Doctor Whoof: Gotta love breaking your understanding of biology
00:49 - Nurse Sexyheart faints
00:50 - The Doctor's Son scans Nurse Sexyheart with his sonic.
00:50 - The Doctor's Son: Her brain has overloaded.
00:50 - The Doctor's Son: What's the pony equivallent of a hangover?
00:50 - Doctor Whoof: My sonic was stolen by squirels
00:50 - The Doctor's Son: ...
00:50 - Doctor Whoof: A hayngover
00:50 - The Doctor's Son gives Doctor Whoof a suspicious glance.
00:51 - Doctor Whoof: What?
00:51 - The Doctor's Son: She's going to wake up with a HELL of a confounded headache.
00:51 - Doctor Whoof: Okay then
00:51 - Doctor Whoof: I was shot earlier anyway
00:51 - Doctor Whoof: I have wounds to tend to
00:51 - The Doctor's Son: Now, I crashed here a few nights ago, and I'd like to know why my TARDIS has vanished.
00:51 - The Doctor's Son: Where were you shot?
00:52 - Doctor Whoof: The lung
00:52 - The Doctor's Son: How many lungs do you have?
00:52 - Doctor Whoof: Amazed it didn't pierce my hearts
00:52 - Doctor Whoof: Two
00:52 - The Doctor's Son: Oh, you've got two as well?  Hearts, I mean. . .
00:52 - Doctor Whoof: I think the bullet is still bouncing around...
00:52 - The Doctor's Son: ...
00:52 - Doctor Whoof: Yes hearts, I have two
00:52 - The Doctor's Son: that's not good.
00:53 - Doctor Whoof: I'll liv
00:53 - The Doctor's Son: Or regenerate.
00:53 - Doctor Whoof: I've had worse
00:53 - Doctor Whoof: No, I can't
00:53 - The Doctor's Son: Assuming Time Ponies CAN regenerate. . .
00:53 - Doctor Whoof: Last one
00:53 - The Doctor's Son: Oh.
00:53 - Doctor Whoof: I would've by now
00:53 - The Doctor's Son: Well, if you absorb the Untempered Schizm you get unlimited regenerations.
00:53 - The Doctor's Son: I did that on my second face.
00:54 - Doctor Whoof: Not a good idea for ponies
00:54 - The Doctor's Son: Saved a Colonel's life. . .
00:54 - The Doctor's Son is reminiscent.
00:54 - Doctor Whoof: And basically, timeponys are identical to timelords
00:54 - The Doctor's Son: Hmm?
00:54 - Doctor Whoof: Exept ponies
00:54 - The Doctor's Son snaps out of it.
00:54 - The Doctor's Son: Okay. . .nearest hospital?
00:55 - The Doctor's Son: Wait, what are you doing here?
00:55 - The Doctor's Son: You don't turn up unless there's trouble, if you're anything like me. . .
00:55 - The Doctor's Son: DId the crashing TARDIS set something off?
00:55 - The Doctor's Son is now pacing madly.
00:55 - Doctor Whoof: Time's falling apart
00:55 - Doctor Whoof: And mine died
00:55 - The Doctor's Son: Well, that's a result of the crash.
00:55 - Doctor Whoof: After I was shot
00:55 - The Doctor's Son: Time falling apart, I mean.
00:56 - The Doctor's Son: Who's in charge?
00:56 - The Doctor's Son: And where do I get a bucket of water?
00:56 - Doctor Whoof: Well, red basically tried to murder me
00:56 - The Doctor's Son: Red?
00:56 - Doctor Whoof: So, she's in charge of the crazy group
00:56 - Doctor Whoof: Nurse redheart
00:56 - The Doctor's Son: The one who's fainted?
00:57 - The Doctor's Son: I just caught 'nurse'
00:57 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
00:57 - The Doctor's Son: Ah. . .
00:57 - Nurse Sexyheart: (wait so, is this happening in our adventure?)
00:57 - The Doctor's Son: (Apparently)
00:57 - Nurse Sexyheart: (or are you meta rp'ing?)
00:57 - Doctor Whoof: (Meta)
00:57 - The Doctor's Son: (Meta?)
00:57 - Nurse Sexyheart: (kk)
00:57 - Doctor Whoof: (Practice I suppose
00:57 - Doctor Whoof: )
00:57 - The Doctor's Son: (What's meta rping?)
00:57 - Nurse Sexyheart: (meta is when you view the game from outside, basically)
00:57 - The Doctor's Son: (Ah.)
00:58 - Doctor Whoof: (which is what we're doing)
00:58 - The Doctor's Son: Okay, so tell me everything important that's happened.
00:58 - Doctor Whoof: (while Rping)
00:58 - Doctor Whoof: Well, I crashed on the princesses balcony
00:58 - Doctor Whoof: I screwed up time
00:58 - The Doctor's Son: ...
00:58 - The Doctor's Son: -_-
00:58 - The Doctor's Son: I keep telling you not to do that.
00:58 - Doctor Whoof: And I made the TARDIE sick
00:58 - The Doctor's Son: That's how we got stranded on that island.
00:58 - Doctor Whoof: And then she died
00:59 - The Doctor's Son: That's what attracted my TARDIS.
00:59 - Doctor Whoof: Yes yes, I know
00:59 - Doctor Whoof: More than likely
00:59 - Doctor Whoof: Also
00:59 - Doctor Whoof: It's now a TARDIE
00:59 - The Doctor's Son: Mine?
00:59 - The Doctor's Son: No.
00:59 - Doctor Whoof: You're in equestria
00:59 - The Doctor's Son: Yes, I am.
00:59 - The Doctor's Son: I'm also in space.
00:59 - Doctor Whoof: So was mine
00:59 - The Doctor's Son: Technically speaking.
01:00 - The Doctor's Son: Besides, mine wasn't grown here.
01:00 - Doctor Whoof: Neither was mine
01:00 - The Doctor's Son: Yours was, if DNA magick is anything to go by.
01:00 - Doctor Whoof: Remember
01:00 - Doctor Whoof: Gallophrey
01:00 - The Doctor's Son: The ambient magick in the atmosphere is what made your TARDIS a TARDIE.
01:00 - Doctor Whoof: Eeyup
01:00 - The Doctor's Son: Mine's immune, do to my tinkering.
01:01 - Doctor Whoof: soon yours will convert
01:01 - The Doctor's Son: I modified it heavily after you left.
01:01 - Doctor Whoof: Really?
01:01 - Doctor Whoof: Why?
01:01 - The Doctor's Son: Got all the scans I needed off of you.
01:01 - The Doctor's Son: BECAUSE I LIKE HER THE WAY SHE IS
01:01 - Doctor Whoof: Just don't regenerate
01:01 - The Doctor's Son: Why?
01:01 - Doctor Whoof: while you're here
01:01 - The Doctor's Son: Or, why not?
01:01 - The Doctor's Son: OH
01:01 - The Doctor's Son: I'll turn up as a pony?
01:01 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
01:02 - Doctor Whoof: Romana should be around here somewhere
01:02 - The Doctor's Son: Well, if I can find the TARDIS, I can regenerate in there.
01:02 - The Doctor's Son: By the way, have you seen my dog?
01:02 - Doctor Whoof: No
01:02 - The Doctor's Son: Small, metal, says 'Master' a lot?
01:02 - Doctor Whoof: Nope
01:02 - The Doctor's Son: Damn. . .
01:02 - Doctor Whoof: I knew one like that though
01:02 - Doctor Whoof: Years and years ago
01:03 - The Doctor's Son: What was yours called?
01:03 - Doctor Whoof: K-9
01:03 - The Doctor's Son produces a bag of jelly babies.
01:03 - Doctor Whoof: No
01:03 - The Doctor's Son: Yeah, mine to.
01:03 - The Doctor's Son: K-9 mk10.
01:03 - Doctor Whoof: I see
01:04 - The Doctor's Son: Don't worry.
01:04 - Doctor Whoof: Also
01:04 - The Doctor's Son: No horse parts.
01:04 - The Doctor's Son: I check.
01:04 - Doctor Whoof: Don't eat those with other present
01:04 - The Doctor's Son: Or rather, the TARDIS does.
01:04 - Doctor Whoof: Trust me
01:04 - The Doctor's Son: Well, if I can't eat jelly babies, then let's find my TARDIS so we can leave.
01:04 - Doctor Whoof: Have fun with that
01:05 - Doctor Whoof: Time is breaking
01:05 - The Doctor's Son: Well, I'll have to wait for sleeping beauty here first.
01:05 - The Doctor's Son: And not in the rest of the universe.
01:05 - Doctor Whoof: And possibly sugar
01:05 - Doctor Whoof: Also
01:05 - The Doctor's Son: Sugar?
01:05 - Doctor Whoof: Don't let sugar berry near you if you value your bones
01:05 - The Doctor's Son: ?????
01:05 - Doctor Whoof: SHe breaks things
01:06 - The Doctor's Son: Maybe you should start from the beginning. . .
01:06 - Doctor Whoof: very effectivly
01:06 - The Doctor's Son: How did the TARDIE die?
01:06 - Nurse Sexyheart stirs
01:06 - The Doctor's Son: Oh boy.
01:06 - Nurse Sexyheart: Ah, head hurts...
01:06 - The Doctor's Son: *Master?*
01:06 - The Doctor's Son: (All K9's lines will be in asterisks)
01:06 - Doctor Whoof: (I see)
01:06 - The Doctor's Son: Ah!
01:06 - Doctor Whoof: So
01:07 - Doctor Whoof: redheart
01:07 - The Doctor's Son runs towards the voice.
01:07 - Nurse Sexyheart: What happened Doctor?
01:07 - Doctor Whoof: Off he goes
01:07 - Doctor Whoof: I think chaos just ensued
01:07 - The Doctor's Son: It's your own fault.
01:07 - The Doctor's Son: Your dead TARDIE.
01:07 - The Doctor's Son: And my missing TARDIS.
01:07 - Doctor Whoof: That was red
01:07 - The Doctor's Son finds K-9.
01:07 - Doctor Whoof: She killed it
01:08 - Nurse Sexyheart: I...
01:08 - Doctor Whoof: After shooting me
01:08 - The Doctor's Son: Hello there.  K-9, do you know what happened to the TARDIS?
01:08 - Nurse Sexyheart: I have my reasons.
01:08 - Doctor Whoof: I still forgive you
01:08 - The Doctor's Son: What were they?
01:08 - Nurse Sexyheart: I'm sorry Doctor.
01:08 - Doctor Whoof: It's fine
01:08 - Nurse Sexyheart: I can never make it up to you.
01:08 - Doctor Whoof: We all do what we think is right
01:08 - The Doctor's Son: You can start by helping me find my TARDIS.
01:08 - The Doctor's Son: Oh, HIM Doctor.
01:08 - Doctor Whoof: Oi
01:08 - The Doctor's Son glares.
01:09 - Doctor Whoof: I'm the docotr in this neck of the wood
01:09 - Doctor Whoof puts on sunglasses
01:09 - The Doctor's Son: Without a TARDIS?  I think not.
01:09 - Doctor Whoof: COPE WITH THE CURUMSTANCES
01:09 - The Doctor's Son: Is there any sort of government around here?
01:09 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
01:10 - The Doctor's Son: What sort of government?
01:10 - Doctor Whoof: A...
01:10 - Nurse Sexyheart trots up to the human
01:10 - Doctor Whoof: Monarchy
01:10 - The Doctor's Son: *Scans indicate that the TARDIS is not within 50 miles*
01:10 - Doctor Whoof: A nice one though
01:10 - Doctor Whoof goes to the TARDIE
01:10 - Nurse Sexyheart: Your anatomy...
01:10 - Nurse Sexyheart: Fascinating.
01:10 - Doctor Whoof: I hate when it lands on it's size
01:10 - The Doctor's Son: SO if a blue box were to sudenly appear out of nowhere, who's department is it?
01:10 - Doctor Whoof jumps in
01:11 - Doctor Whoof: Mine
01:11 - The Doctor's Son nervously scoots away from Nurse Red.
01:11 - Doctor Whoof: I'm the alien consultant
01:11 - The Doctor's Son: Well, you wouldn't have had time to hide it more than 50 miles away in the last few hours.
01:11 - Doctor Whoof: In most cases
01:11 - Nurse Sexyheart: Ah, sorry, I mean no harm.
01:11 - Doctor Whoof: Why would I hide it?
01:11 - The Doctor's Son: What about the cases where you're elsewhere?
01:12 - Doctor Whoof: Torchwood: Equestria
01:12 - The Doctor's Son: Oh god.
01:12 - Doctor Whoof: I know
01:12 - The Doctor's Son: Where is it?
01:12 - The Doctor's Son: Who runs it?
01:12 - Doctor Whoof: It's under the mountain
01:12 - The Doctor's Son: And nurse, it's not that.
01:12 - The Doctor's Son: It's the whole "There are actually other talking ponies" thing.
01:12 - Doctor Whoof crawls out of the TARDIE
01:13 - Doctor Whoof: Of course there are
01:13 - The Doctor's Son: You mean the small charming hill, or the BIG THREATENING MOUNTAIN?
01:13 - The Doctor's Son: I bet I can guess. . .
01:13 - Doctor Whoof: The big threatening mountain
01:13 - The Doctor's Son: KNEW it.
01:13 - Nurse Sexyheart: I believe we're in a similar place then sir.
01:13 - Doctor Whoof: With the posh castle
01:13 - The Doctor's Son: Is the castle Torchwood?
01:13 - Doctor Whoof: No
01:13 - The Doctor's Son: Didn't think so.
01:13 - Doctor Whoof: It's the royal palace
01:13 - Doctor Whoof: and the city of canterlot
01:14 - The Doctor's Son: Do you know how to get to Torchwood from here?
01:14 - Doctor Whoof: No, It requires a teleport
01:14 - The Doctor's Son: Ah. . .
01:14 - Doctor Whoof: Or mining equipment
01:14 - The Doctor's Son: Well, a humanoid with two hearts won't stay hidden long.
01:14 - Doctor Whoof: Nope
01:14 - The Doctor's Son: The best way to get picked up would be to stroll bodly into Canterlot.
01:14 - Doctor Whoof: And they sdon't exactly like me
01:15 - Doctor Whoof: So don't expect my friendship to help you
01:15 - The Doctor's Son centers his hat and picks up his trenchcoat.
01:15 - Doctor Whoof: Here
01:15 - Doctor Whoof: the TARDIE is safe
01:15 - The Doctor's Son: And dead.
01:15 - Doctor Whoof: Albeit oriented wrong
01:15 - Doctor Whoof: Oh, hush
01:15 - The Doctor's Son: Well, the artfificial gravity should take care of that.
01:15 - Doctor Whoof: Dead
01:15 - The Doctor's Son: Or, it would, if it were working.
01:16 - The Doctor's Son: Why would I need your TARDIE?
01:16 - Doctor Whoof takes a dive into the TARDIE
01:16 - Doctor Whoof: WEEEEeeeeeee......
01:16 - Doctor Whoof splashes in the pool
01:16 - The Doctor's Son watches the plume of water come out of the doors.
01:16 - The Doctor's Son: That's a neat trick with the gravity wrong. . .
01:16 - Doctor Whoof: I know right!
01:17 - The Doctor's Son: Don't make me tip you.
01:17 - Doctor Whoof: Heh
01:17 - Doctor Whoof: So then
01:17 - The Doctor's Son pushes the TARDIE on its roof, just to prove his point.
01:17 - Doctor Whoof: Owo!
01:17 - The Doctor's Son grins.
01:17 - Doctor Whoof: I was trying to ajust the controls!
01:17 - The Doctor's Son: :)
01:17 - The Doctor's Son: That's what you get for not taking me seriously.
01:17 - Doctor Whoof activates a clock-work sounding device
01:18 - The Doctor's Son: Hold on to something.
01:18 - The Doctor's Son: Or. . .
01:18 - Doctor Whoof: Umm
01:18 - The Doctor's Son: Just hoof onto something.
01:18 - Doctor Whoof flys out
01:18 - The Doctor's Son pushes the TARDIE rightside up.
01:18 - Doctor Whoof: Clockwork wings
01:18 - The Doctor's Son: The ones that broke when you were 3000 feet above the ground?
01:18 - The Doctor's Son: The nurse is very quiet. . .
01:18 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
01:19 - Doctor Whoof: I fixed them
01:19 - The Doctor's Son turns to look at the nurse.
01:19 - Nurse Sexyheart: Um.
01:19 - The Doctor's Son: Yes?
01:19 - Nurse Sexyheart: I'm just.
01:19 - Nurse Sexyheart: Thinking.
01:19 - Doctor Whoof lands
01:19 - The Doctor's Son: Kindof bewildered that I'm not pony?
01:19 - The Doctor's Son: *a pony
01:19 - Doctor Whoof: Trrust me, she needs a moment to think
01:19 - The Doctor's Son: Okay.
01:19 - The Doctor's Son: Who else is there?
01:20 - The Doctor's Son: You two. . .
01:20 - The Doctor's Son: And Romana?
01:20 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
01:20 - Doctor Whoof: She was...
01:20 - The Doctor's Son: Another pony?
01:20 - Doctor Whoof: No, Romana is not with us right now
01:20 - The Doctor's Son: Is she a pony?
01:21 - The Doctor's Son: And do you know what happened to her?
01:21 - Doctor Whoof: (The "normal" group is berry punch nurse redheart the lobe sugar berry, and waffle)
01:21 - Doctor Whoof: (Celestia is a common guest/ admin of the group)
01:21 - The Doctor's Son: (I see)
01:21 - Doctor Whoof: Yes, she escaped the time war
01:21 - The Doctor's Son: Surprising.
01:22 - Doctor Whoof: She crashed in equestria
01:22 - The Doctor's Son: Not surprising.
01:22 - Doctor Whoof: and lost her memory
01:22 - The Doctor's Son: What with you confounding up time.
01:22 - The Doctor's Son: Now that IS surprising. . .
01:22 - Doctor Whoof: No, she's been here longer than me
01:22 - The Doctor's Son: Doesn't really make a difference.
01:23 - The Doctor's Son: A TARDIS exists in all points of time at once.
01:23 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
01:23 - The Doctor's Son: Romana's TARDIS sensed your future meddling, that's why she crashed as opposed to landing.
01:23 - Doctor Whoof: Okay
01:23 - The Doctor's Son: HOW exactly DID you break time?
01:23 - Doctor Whoof: but she can't help right now
01:23 - Doctor Whoof: I'm not sure
01:23 - Doctor Whoof: the TARDIE got sick
01:23 - The Doctor's Son: How?
01:23 - Doctor Whoof: I DON'T KNOW
01:23 - The Doctor's Son: . . .
01:24 - Doctor Whoof: Sorry.
01:24 - Doctor Whoof: I'm just trying to leep from breaking down here
01:24 - The Doctor's Son: Umm. . .
01:24 - The Doctor's Son: Okay.
01:24 - The Doctor's Son: Well you're doing better than the nurse.
01:24 - The Doctor's Son: I feel like I've said that before. . .
01:24 - The Doctor's Son is lost in thought.
01:25 - Nurse Sexyheart is turned away from the two, silently crying
01:25 - The Doctor's Son notices the nurse crying.
01:25 - Doctor Whoof walks up to redheart
01:25 - Doctor Whoof: Whats wrong?
01:25 - The Doctor's Son: Why are you crying?
01:25 - Nurse Sexyheart: It's all my fault.
01:25 - The Doctor's Son glances at Doctor Whoof and mutters "All fools think alike"
01:25 - Nurse Sexyheart: All of it.
01:25 - Doctor Whoof shoots a glance at Mothoid
01:26 - Doctor Whoof: It's okay
01:26 - The Doctor's Son sits next to the nurse.
01:26 - The Doctor's Son: It's not.
01:26 - Doctor Whoof: you did what you thought was right
01:26 - The Doctor's Son: Anything that happens, happens, and there isn't a thing we can do to change it.
01:26 - Nurse Sexyheart: But I...
01:26 - The Doctor's Son: Yes, you shot Doctor Whoof.
01:26 - The Doctor's Son: He's still alive.
01:26 - Nurse Sexyheart: Barely.
01:27 - The Doctor's Son: Still breaking time, and generaly being a pain in my ass.
01:27 - Doctor Whoof: That was DEFINATLY me
01:27 - The Doctor's Son: Breaking time?
01:27 - The Doctor's Son: Yeah, it was.
01:27 - Doctor Whoof: That or the doctor screwed something up because of our meddling
01:27 - The Doctor's Son: REALLY the person who's fault it is is the person who made the TARDIE sick. . .
01:27 - Doctor Whoof: Me, more than likely
01:28 - The Doctor's Son: And that wouldn't mess things up, *I* know what I'm doing.
01:28 - Doctor Whoof: SURE you do
01:28 - Doctor Whoof: Mister timelord
01:28 - The Doctor's Son: Well, usually.
01:28 - The Doctor's Son: Right now, I'm missing the best friend I've ever had in the universe.
01:28 - The Doctor's Son: And Sir Prancelot here. . .
01:28 - The Doctor's Son jerks his thumb at Doctor Whoof
01:29 - The Doctor's Son: tells me that shes' in the hands of Torchwood.
01:29 - The Doctor's Son: Which I won't allow.

01:29 - Nurse Sexyheart: (have fun you two)
01:29 - Doctor Whoof: (bye)
01:29 - The Doctor's Son: (See ya)
01:29 - The Lobe: (Bai Red)
01:29 - Nurse Sexyheart faints again
Nurse Sexyheart disconnected.
01:29 - The Doctor's Son facepalms.
01:29 - Doctor Whoof: (we now have 3 stories on hold -_-)
01:30 - Doctor Whoof: So
01:30 - The Doctor's Son: So
01:30 - Doctor Whoof: Why is everything automaticly my fault?
01:30 - Doctor Whoof: JUST because of the fact it;s in equestria?
01:30 - The Doctor's Son: Because you look ridiculous.
01:31 - The Doctor's Son: 3D glasses?
01:31 - The Doctor's Son: Really?
01:31 - Doctor Whoof: Wow

01:34 - The Doctor's Son: Not my dad's.

01:34 - Doctor Whoof: Basically
01:34 - The Doctor's Son: Okay.
01:35 - The Doctor's Son: I'll go with that until a better explanation presents itself.
01:35 - Doctor Whoof: I love using my pony-ness to mess with your head
01:35 - The Doctor's Son: Oh, go confound yourself.

01:37 - Filly Celestia: :/
01:37 - The Doctor's Son: *Squirrels, master?
01:37 - The Doctor's Son: *
01:37 - Filly Celestia: you guys are silly
01:37 - Doctor Whoof: Well, I can't keep ahold of the darned sonic anyway
01:37 - The Doctor's Son: Yeah.  Hooves.
01:37 - Doctor Whoof: I have plenty of stories
01:37 - The Doctor's Son twiddles his thumbs to prove his point.
01:37 - Doctor Whoof: I always liked thumbs
01:37 - The Doctor's Son: OOH LOOK!
01:38 - Doctor Whoof looks
01:38 - The Doctor's Son has noticed something shinty.
01:38 - The Doctor's Son *shiny
01:38 - The Doctor's Son bends over and picks it up.
01:38 - The Doctor's Son: You know what this is?
01:38 - Doctor Whoof: SHiney.....
01:38 - The Doctor's Son: This is an info-stamp.
01:38 - Doctor Whoof shakes his head rappidly
01:38 - The Doctor's Son: It looks brandnew. . .
01:39 - Doctor Whoof: Sorry, still a pony
01:39 - The Doctor's Son: ...
01:39 - Doctor Whoof: distracted by shineys
01:39 - Filly Celestia: :/
01:39 - Doctor Whoof: Weird
01:39 - The Doctor's Son pushes the button on the info-stamp.
01:39 - Doctor Whoof ducks
01:39 - The Doctor's Son: (I'm going to use ^'s to show actions)
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: ^The info-stamp shows a hologram of a Cyberman^
01:40 - Filly Celestia: So... um.. which one of you is the good guy... which one of you is abad guy?
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: Wait. . .
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: We're both good guys.
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: I crashed here.
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: And Torchwood has my TARDIS.
01:40 - Filly Celestia: i see
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: THESE, on the other hand. . .
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: Definetly cybermen. . .
01:40 - Doctor Whoof: I crashed in your balcony
01:40 - Filly Celestia: RAPIST
01:40 - Filly Celestia runs
01:40 - Doctor Whoof: Sorry about that
01:40 - Doctor Whoof: ....
01:40 - Doctor Whoof: long storry
01:40 - The Doctor's Son: But why would the cybermen have an infostamp on the cybermen?
01:41 - The Doctor's Son: Unless. . .
01:41 - Doctor Whoof: History?
01:41 - The Doctor's Son: No. . .
01:41 - The Doctor's Son: These aren't Cyber-stamps.
01:41 - The Doctor's Son: Look at the markings.
01:41 - The Doctor's Son: These are Dalek.
01:41 - Filly Celestia is watching the two crazy ponies talk from a safe distance
01:41 - The Doctor's Son: Which explains why it was dropped.
01:42 - Doctor Whoof: I guess
01:42 - The Doctor's Son: I mean, it's VERY difficult to hold an info-stamp with a suction cup.
01:42 - Doctor Whoof: Or hooves for that ,atter
01:42 - The Doctor's Son: My guess is that they're using Cybermen as slaves, or maybe they've allied again. . .
01:42 - The Lobe: (i'mma go to bed now, i've got a log up to this point. if you wanna keep what's going to happen now, you're gonna have to log it)
