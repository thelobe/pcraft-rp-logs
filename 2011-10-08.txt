21:55 - The Lobe is now on the bed again, weakishly stroking Sugar's mane
21:55 - Doctor Whoof: We can't let her have alchohol for the next day either

22:28 - Thunder Wing runs off and comes back with a martini
22:28 - Thunder Wing: Here you go
22:28 - Berry Punch takes the martini and downs it
22:28 - The Lobe: (methinks healing would still take very long... maybe some unicron healing magicks could speed this up considerably... though snuggly-wuggly with sugar is nice as well) (plus, i really like what's going on in the other room right now... it's funny as hell)
22:28 - Berry Punch: more.
22:28 - Thunder Wing: More?

22:30 - Berry Punch shakes head
22:30 - The Lobe: (np at all, thought you've deliberately decided against that, just wanted to make sure :) )
22:30 - Thunder Wing: You alright?
22:30 - Berry Punch gives a big hug to thunder
22:30 - Sugarberry: (Let's just say I did magicool healing and you're all good now then?)
22:30 - Berry Punch: I think so!

22:51 - Doctor Whoof: I think I have it here
22:51 - The Lobe smiles "Heh... you don't like it?"
22:51 - Doctor Whoof pulls camera out of bag
22:51 - Crystal Rhapsody breaks into a smile. "Thank you so much!"
22:51 - Doctor Whoof: (keep in mind this is a jet black pony standing up on two legs
22:52 - Crystal Rhapsody grabs it with magic, inspecting the camera carefully
22:52 - Crystal Rhapsody: ...why're you standing all funny?
22:52 - Berry Punch giggles
22:52 - Sugarberry: Well it's not something I-I'm used to.. but it is nice..

22:53 - Doctor Whoof: *while IT's on fire)
22:53 - The Lobe starts kissing Sugarberry again, getting more passionate with each kiss
22:55 - Doctor Whoof: So
22:55 - The Lobe: (dunno if i should worry or laugh... my gf just told me she's totally okay with me doing this, as long as, quote "you don't imagine me as a pony when we make out")
22:55 - Sugarberry: (lawl wat)
22:55 - Crystal Rhapsody: ((hahaha))
22:55 - Berry Punch: (wat)
22:55 - Crystal Rhapsody: ((I do way too much of this, so...))

22:56 - Doctor Whoof: So
22:56 - Sugarberry snuggles into an embrace with Lobe
22:56 - Doctor Whoof: other than the wounds, how are you feeling?
22:57 - Crystal Rhapsody 's horn glows, and his bandaged side ripples, distorting briefly and refocusing unmarred and flawless
22:57 - Crystal Rhapsody: pretty good...
22:57 - Doctor Whoof: ....
22:57 - Doctor Whoof: wow, a healer
22:57 - Crystal Rhapsody: oh, no, its just an illusion...that's what im good at. Appearance is everything, right?
22:58 - Doctor Whoof: I suppose
22:58 - Doctor Whoof: I just wish I could wash off this black dye
22:58 - Doctor Whoof: I've had it on for 1001 years
22:58 - Crystal Rhapsody: have you tried the spa?
22:58 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
22:58 - Doctor Whoof: Stupid lunar republic dye
22:59 - Berry Punch salutes the air, then acts like she did nothing
22:59 - Crystal Rhapsody: well...hmm...if you had a gem of some kind, there's a good quick fix.
23:00 - Doctor Whoof: Good to know
23:00 - Doctor Whoof: I'll let you know some time
23:00 - Crystal Rhapsody: alright.
23:00 - Doctor Whoof: I've never even SEEN my current color
23:00 - Crystal Rhapsody sits back down on the bed, rubbing his seemingly uninjured side lightly
23:00 - Doctor Whoof: But that's for another time
23:01 - Doctor Whoof: So, is there something you were doing when you were stabbed?
23:02 - The Lobe holds Sugarberry tight, as he starts kissing down her neck
23:02 - Crystal Rhapsody: Well, I was coming here to photograph the town in advance for a journalist, investigating the dissapearances and strange phenomenon occuring in the town..
23:02 - Doctor Whoof: Phenomenon?
23:02 - Doctor Whoof: I LOVE those
23:02 - Doctor Whoof: what are they?
23:03 - The Lobe: (just so i know, sugarberry looks like the canon sugarberry, right?)
23:03 - Crystal Rhapsody: Er...so far its mostly just some blurry photos of strange shapes in the air, and creatures in the woods....
23:03 - Doctor Whoof: Oooo
23:03 - Crystal Rhapsody: but I'm going to fix that with this baby...
23:03 - Sugarberry: (Yah Lobe, and afk for a bit)
23:03 - Crystal Rhapsody pats the camera now hanging around his neck
23:03 - Doctor Whoof looks at waffle in all seriousness
23:04 - Doctor Whoof: See any of them yourself?

23:05 - Crystal Rhapsody: well, that stabby pony was...different, but so far, nothing aside from this weird blue fog over the forest...I got a couple shots of it...
23:05 - Doctor Whoof: Blue fog?
23:05 - Doctor Whoof: did it sparkle?
23:07 - Crystal Rhapsody: ...a little...?

00:01 - Nurse Redheart blushes lightly, remembering her own encounter with Thunder

00:02 - Doctor Whoof: So,
00:02 - Doctor Whoof: this is the main console
00:02 - Doctor Whoof: don't touch anything
00:02 - Doctor Whoof: It's what allows us to control the time-travel
00:03 - Doctor Whoof: as well as space travel
00:03 - Nurse Redheart: It was very intriguing, I wish I had been able to study so more of its effects on the native biology.
00:05 - Berry Punch closes book
00:05 - Berry Punch: readin about alcohol just makes me want alcohol
00:05 - Crystal Rhapsody: awesome...what that over there?
00:05 - Crystal Rhapsody points to the other side of the room
00:06 - Nurse Redheart: Yes, that would seem counter-intuitive.
00:06 - Nurse Redheart: Are there any other subjects that interest you?
00:06 - Nurse Redheart: This library has all sorts of books
00:06 - Doctor Whoof: That's the comfy chair

00:11 - Nurse Redheart: This is the Book of Everything.
00:11 - Nurse Redheart: I found it in here once, when I couldn't decide what to read.
00:11 - Berry Punch perks up
00:12 - Doctor Whoof: This is where the food court, library with swimming pool, ice-rink Etc. is
00:12 - Nurse Redheart: It looks really small, but it can tell you anything you want to know.
00:12 - Berry Punch: its... so small.
00:12 - Berry Punch pokes it
00:12 - Nurse Redheart: It's kind of like the TARDIE now that I think about it.
00:13 - Sugarberry leans back from Lobe, head tilted to the side eyes closed panting "Mmm.. d-don't stop.."
00:13 - Crystal Rhapsody takes a couple pictures
00:13 - Nurse Redheart: Oh, a word of warning Berry.

00:14 - Nurse Redheart: You can't read that page.
00:14 - Nurse Redheart: Ever.
00:14 - Berry Punch: i....   that goes against every instinct i have... you tell me not to do something, so i want to it.
00:15 - Crystal Rhapsody: that sounds good...thank you for the hospitality!
00:15 - Nurse Redheart: Oh my, if you did...
00:15 - Nurse Redheart: It would be very bad for all of us.
00:15 - Doctor Whoof: it's okay waffle
00:16 - Berry Punch: if nopony's read it, how do you know that it would be bad to do so?
00:16 - Doctor Whoof: no reason you should starve

00:17 - Crystal Rhapsody: wow....
00:17 - Berry Punch: well, i think i wont.  i wont on purpose anyway.
00:17 - Crystal Rhapsody walks in, smiling wider
00:17 - Doctor Whoof: Exept ambrosia
00:17 - The Lobe continues licking and kissing Sugarberry's belly, going further down with every step. Shortly above her vulva, he freezes, then continues to kiss her belly, going up this time
00:17 - Nurse Redheart: Alright.
00:17 - Doctor Whoof: Of the gods anyway
00:18 - Nurse Redheart: I trust you to be careful.
00:18 - Nurse Redheart: ((clop))
00:18 - Doctor Whoof: Normal ambrosia is fine
00:18 - Berry Punch: heh, i hope i can live up to your trust -_-;;
00:18 - Crystal Rhapsody: ((lol))
00:18 - Doctor Whoof: Just enter it on the panel there
00:18 - Berry Punch opens book to a random page
00:18 - Doctor Whoof points to an array of 27 panels

00:19 - Doctor Whoof: it can seat 200

00:22 - Doctor Whoof: I imagine having telekanises is handy
00:22 - Doctor Whoof starts eating as well
00:23 - Sugarberry leans back further so she's now laying on her back, looking lustily up at him "Ah.. s-stop.. t-t-teasing.."
00:23 - Berry Punch is completely enthralled with the history of the nomadic Pepsi tribe that live around Mt. Dew in 800s Ireland.

00:24 - Sugarberry: (lawl Berry)

00:26 - Nurse Redheart: ((all of my clop))
00:26 - Crystal Rhapsody: ((its pretty hot))
00:27 - The Lobe smiles at her, going further upwards. He starts gently biting Sugarberry's neck, while slowly moving a hoof downwards towards her vulva, gently stroking the area around.
00:27 - Crystal Rhapsody: ((I need to seduce redheart >.>))
00:27 - Nurse Redheart: ((tee hee))

00:30 - Sugarberry shivers and bites down on her lip to stiffle a moan as each of his touches sends a shock rippling through her body
00:30 - Doctor Whoof goes over to waffle
00:30 - Doctor Whoof: So, how's you food?

00:35 - Doctor Whoof: *door
00:35 - Crystal Rhapsody walks inside
00:35 - Crystal Rhapsody: hi everypony!
00:35 - Doctor Whoof: Whats interesting
00:36 - Berry Punch: wuzzit?  haiii
00:36 - Doctor Whoof: is that the library will grow to accomodate more books if more are written
00:36 - Nurse Redheart: Oh, Waffle, come help us with this.
00:36 - Crystal Rhapsody: hmm?
00:36 - Doctor Whoof: Hmm?
00:36 - Crystal Rhapsody walks over to the pretty mare
00:36 - Nurse Redheart: This trap door.
00:36 - Doctor Whoof: Looking at a book can't be THAT hard
00:36 - Nurse Redheart points to the door.
00:36 - Doctor Whoof: Oh
00:36 - Crystal Rhapsody: alright, glad to help!
00:36 - Berry Punch: i cant get my hoof under it
00:36 - Doctor Whoof walks up as well
00:36 - Nurse Redheart: Lift it with your magic please.
00:36 - Doctor Whoof: Hm'mm
00:36 - Crystal Rhapsody pops the trapdoor open with a burst of magic
00:37 - Doctor Whoof: Are we sure this is a good idea?
00:37 - Berry Punch: ...dusteh
00:37 - Nurse Redheart: Oh, Doctor, do you know what this is?
00:37 - Doctor Whoof: Good point
00:37 - Nurse Redheart: I've never seen it before?
00:37 - Berry Punch hops down
00:37 - Doctor Whoof: GERONIMO
00:37 - Doctor Whoof jumps in first
00:37 - Doctor Whoof: (or not)
00:37 - Berry Punch: ((too slow :P))
00:37 - Nurse Redheart: I suppose I should follow...
00:37 - Berry Punch: ish dark
00:38 - Nurse Redheart hops in
00:38 - Nurse Redheart: Doctor, do you have any lights?
00:38 - Crystal Rhapsody jumps in, horn lighting up and a small orb of light poffing into existence
00:38 - Sugarberry musters a nod, breathing heavily and brightly flushed pushing herself against his hoof "ah.. it feels so g-good.. ah.. I-I want more.."
00:39 - Doctor Whoof: Okay
00:39 - Nurse Redheart: Oh!  Thank's Waffle.
00:39 - Doctor Whoof puts away the torch
00:39 - Nurse Redheart: ((someone else decide what we see, I'm too lazy))
00:39 - Crystal Rhapsody: yerah...I cant really affect things, but light and stuff is easy to change...
00:40 - Berry Punch: ((its whoof's ship..))
00:40 - Doctor Whoof: That's handy
00:40 - Crystal Rhapsody: great for photoshoots.
00:40 - Doctor Whoof: (I'll think of something in a moment)
00:40 - Doctor Whoof: I imagine
00:40 - Nurse Redheart: ((kk))
00:40 - Doctor Whoof: speaking of, why ARE you taking so many pictures?
00:41 - Crystal Rhapsody: Well...this is a pretty cool place...and this definitley counts as weird.
00:41 - Doctor Whoof: Fair point
00:41 - Doctor Whoof: *you came to a room that changes color, mildly at first*
00:42 - Doctor Whoof: Wow
00:42 - Doctor Whoof: Since when was this here?
00:42 - Nurse Redheart: What is this place Doctor?
00:42 - Doctor Whoof puts on weird 3-d glasses
00:42 - Doctor Whoof: I'm not sure
00:42 - Doctor Whoof: That's new
00:42 - The Lobe goes down again, while still softly rubbing his hoof against her vag. He then starts licking her, gently at first, but getting more determined and sensual by the minute. His hooves reach up, and hold her twitching body firmly by the flank
00:43 - Nurse Redheart: How is there a room that you don't know about?
00:43 - Doctor Whoof: Maybe it's currently being made?
00:43 - Doctor Whoof: I'm not sure
00:43 - Crystal Rhapsody rubs his side a little, the spell faltering slightly and bandages showing, vauge and transparent, before vanishing again
00:43 - Crystal Rhapsody: ((clopclopclop))
00:43 - Berry Punch: Did I break the TARDIE again?
00:43 - Doctor Whoof: Are you SURE you're okay?
00:43 - Doctor Whoof: No
00:43 - Doctor Whoof: Not this time
00:43 - Nurse Redheart: Wait, being made?  Right now?
00:43 - Doctor Whoof: THIS time
00:43 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
00:44 - Doctor Whoof: it happens sometimes
00:44 - Doctor Whoof: when we change history
00:44 - Doctor Whoof: It makes new revised vollumes
00:44 - Doctor Whoof: As to not over-write previous ones
00:44 - Nurse Redheart: hm
00:45 - Doctor Whoof: That's why some history seems wonky in most of the books
00:45 - Doctor Whoof: Mostly my doing
00:45 - Nurse Redheart: All this time stuff hurts my brain...
00:45 - Crystal Rhapsody: yeah..
00:45 - Berry Punch: I can't process any of this... not drunk enough...
00:45 - Doctor Whoof: WATCH FOR THAT BOOK!!
00:45 - Doctor Whoof ducks
00:45 - Doctor Whoof: Yes
00:45 - Nurse Redheart gets hit in the head by the book
00:45 - Doctor Whoof: Its a new room
00:46 - Doctor Whoof looks at the book
00:46 - Crystal Rhapsody hurries over to red. "You alright?"
00:46 - Nurse Redheart: ((I'm heading out apparently))
00:46 - Doctor Whoof: "101 jokes about nightmare moon".... WHAT?
00:46 - Nurse Redheart is knocked unconcious, again
00:47 - Doctor Whoof: Lets get her to the medical bay
00:47 - The Lobe: (brb, getting a drink)
00:47 - Doctor Whoof: (okay)
00:47 - Berry Punch sees a hallway off in a dark corner of the room
00:47 - Crystal Rhapsody pulls Redheart up onto his back
00:47 - Berry Punch wanders towards it
00:47 - Doctor Whoof starts doging books
00:48 - Doctor Whoof: Ah!
00:48 - Doctor Whoof: SO. MANY. BOOKS.
00:48 - Crystal Rhapsody starts walking back towards the ladder, ducking his head as books hit his sides
00:48 - Crystal Rhapsody: ow, ow, ow
00:48 - The Lobe: (back)
00:48 - Berry Punch: i cant count to all these books!
00:48 - Berry Punch ducks into hallway to get out of the bookstorm
00:49 - Doctor Whoof blocks one side of waffle
00:49 - Crystal Rhapsody stumbles back into the library, Redheart laying next to him
00:49 - Doctor Whoof: There, I'll see what happens down here
00:49 - Doctor Whoof runs to the hallway
00:50 - Crystal Rhapsody nudges Redheart gently
00:50 - Doctor Whoof pulls out the torch
00:50 - Doctor Whoof: Okay
00:50 - Berry Punch: wuzzit?
00:51 - Crystal Rhapsody: Miss Redheart? Are you okay?
00:51 - Doctor Whoof: It's a new section of the library
00:51 - Doctor Whoof: A COMPLETELY new section
00:52 - Crystal Rhapsody shakes redheart gently
00:52 - Nurse Redheart mumbles something about books before drifting into unconciousness
00:52 - Berry Punch: but why?  why so many at once?
00:52 - Nurse Redheart: ((kbai))
Nurse Redheart disconnected.
00:52 - The Lobe: (wat)
00:52 - Crystal Rhapsody pulls Redheart onto his back and walks for the medical wing
00:52 - Doctor Whoof: okay
00:53 - Doctor Whoof: I think that we did something to time
00:53 - Doctor Whoof: Well, most likely I
00:53 - Crystal Rhapsody lays Redheart out on a bed, suddenly feeling a little faint himself
00:54 - Crystal Rhapsody curls up on the floor next to her bed, illusions flickering away as he sleeps, revealing the bloodstained bandages
00:54 - Berry Punch: ((i actually need to go myself.  food, stuff i need to do, life, etc.  dunno when ill be back on... sooo... feel free to continue onward without me))
00:54 - Doctor Whoof: (I think this is a good time to endthe session)
00:55 - Berry Punch: (prolleh)
00:55 - Doctor Whoof: (SESSION PAUSE)

01:02 - The Lobe moves up, visibly aroused. He moves over Sugarberry, kissing and biting at her neck. His erect member pressing lighty against her vag, he seeks her eyes. "I want you. Here. And now." He smiles at her, cheeks flushed with excitement
01:02 - Crystal Rhapsody clops furiously
